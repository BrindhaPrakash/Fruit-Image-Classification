# Fruit-Image-Classification

This repository contains a TensorFlow-based deep learning project for classifying images of fruits using the ResNet architecture.
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model for fruit image classification. It uses the ResNet50V2 architecture and includes data loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and model compilation steps.
